# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to address the possibility of academic dishonesty on standardized testing for Py City Schools. There is suspicion that the scores have been altered for Thomas High School 9th graders so this report explores what the data would look like if all 9th grade scores from Thomas High School were nullified and the remaining scores recalculated.  Only the raw scores have been considered in this report. No other context into the situation was given.

## Results
### District Summary
INSERT DISTRICT SUMMARY PICTURES

There were no significant changes between the original and altered averages over all schools.  Being that Thomas High School freshmen make up 1% of the total district student population, ommitting their scores made only a minor difference.  The district average scores were each reduced by less than 1%.

### School Summary / Effect on Math and Reading Scores
INSERT THOMAS STATS

Whenever a sample size is reduced, the values in it carry more weight, so the expectation is that the overall scores will change, as we can see in the above chart.  They did not change by much within Thomas High School, though.  This indicates that the scores were not outliers in the dataset and that they were close to the averages of the other grades calculated.  Omitting the 9th grade scores reduced the school averages by less than 0.5% for math, reading, and passing averages for both.

### Performance Compared to Other Schools
INSERT SCHOOL SUMMARY PICS

Removing the 9th grade scores may have changed Thomas High School's overall scores within their school, but it did not alter their position in a ranking of all schools from highest overall passing scores to lowest. Thomas High still ranks 2nd among all 15 schools.  Had the 9th grade scores been significantly higher than the rest of the school, the expectation would be that the recalculated scores would have dropped much more than they did and, consequently, for Thomas High School to drop in ranking.  This did not happen.

## Summary
Thomas High School's scores did not change significantly when 461 freshman scores werenullified and the rest were recalculated.  That means that the 9th grade scores were not skewed enough to push the averages and that the 9th grade scores were close to the averages of the rest of the grades.  This does not mean they were not tampered with, it means they were not significantly different enough to affect the scores as a whole.

As making the 9th grade scores null did not significantly affect the data, this method to determine academic honesty regarding Reading and Math test scores at Thomas High School is inconclusive.  There is not enough evidence to determine whether the scores were or were not tampered with.

My suggestion for next steps would be to explore why the school board feels there has been academic dishonesty and what in particular about the the data seems suspicious.  The next logical step would be to investigate the testing procedures in place by Thomas High School to see if and where there could have been opportunity for tampering.  Based on my calculations, the answer won't be found in the scores themselves.
